# GDP_Life-expectancy--Codecademy_data_visualization-portfolio


Introduction:
The relationship between GDP and life expectancy of six countries—the United States, Zimbabwe, Germany, Mexico, Chile, and China—was investigated over the period from 2000 to 2015. To analyze the data, we utilized Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and NumPy for numerical operations. Initially, a comprehensive investigation was conducted to understand the structure of the DataFrame and to identify any missing or NaN values. Subsequently, scatter plots were used to visualize general trends across the countries. Finally, a regression model was employed to examine how changes in GDP are associated with changes in life expectancy in all countries.


General Trends:
There is a noticeable positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy across most countries.
Zimbabwe is an outlier with significantly lower GDP and life expectancy compared to the other countries.
For developed countries (Germany, USA, Chile), life expectancy is high and relatively stable, even with varying GDP.
Developing countries (China, Mexico) show a gradual increase in life expectancy with increasing GDP.
The data suggests that while higher GDP generally correlates with higher life expectancy, the relationship can vary significantly based on other factors such as country-specific economic, social, and healthcare conditions.


Interpretation:
This graph highlights the economic disparities and their potential impact on public health as represented by life expectancy. Developed countries with higher GDP tend to have higher and more stable life expectancies. Developing countries show improvements in life expectancy as their economies grow. Zimbabwe, with a much lower GDP, demonstrates the challenges faced by lower-income countries in improving life expectancy.
